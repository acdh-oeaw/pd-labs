# PARTHENOS Discovery Labs

Various scripts and results for exploring and curating the data of the [PARTHENOS Project](http://www.parthenos-project.eu/).


[PARTHENOS Discovery](https://parthenos.acdh.oeaw.ac.at/) is an application that gives access to the metadata records contributed by the partners of the PARTHENOS project, research infrastructures and initiatives in the broad domain of humanities and cultural heritage.
These records are being regularly harvested   converted into a common semantic model, the PARTHENOS Entities Model (PEM) and ingested into a triple store. PARTHENOS Discovery allows to navigate, explore and search this data.

Due to the heterogeneity and idiosyncracies of the contributed datasets as well as due to the complex mapping process, the aggregated dataset exhibits a number of [issues regarding the data quality](DataQuality.md)

Nevertheless, we believe the resulting combined dataset is an exciting resource, allowing a synoptic view over a huge dataspace. It represents a solid basis for further curation and harmonisation efforts.

This repository is meant to offer means for advanced querying and evaluation of the dataset as well as to keep track of curation issues.
